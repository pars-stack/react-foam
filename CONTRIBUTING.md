## Contributing Guidelines

### Philosophy

React Foam is built on these core principles:

1. **Simplicity First**: Keep the API minimal and intuitive
2. **Performance**: Every change should maintain or improve performance
3. **Zero Dependencies**: Avoid adding external dependencies
4. **TypeScript**: All code must be written in TypeScript
5. **Testing**: Maintain 100% test coverage
6. **Documentation**: Document all public APIs and changes

### What We're Looking For

**High Priority Contributions:**
- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- Documentation improvements
- Test coverage improvements
- TypeScript type improvements

**Medium Priority Contributions:**
- New utility functions that align with our philosophy
- Developer experience improvements
- Build system improvements
- Example applications

**Please Discuss First:**
- New major features
- Breaking changes
- Architectural changes
- New dependencies

### What We're Not Looking For

- Features that significantly increase bundle size
- Complex APIs that go against our simplicity principle
- Features that require external dependencies
- Features that duplicate existing React functionality

## Pull Request Process

### Before You Start

1. Check existing issues and PRs to avoid duplicates
2. For major changes, open an issue first to discuss
3. Make sure you understand the project philosophy
4. Ensure you have time to see the PR through to completion

### Making Changes

1. Create a new branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following our coding standards
3. Add or update tests as needed
4. Update documentation if necessary
5. Ensure all tests pass and linting is clean

### Commit Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add computed values utility
fix: prevent memory leak in store subscriptions
docs: update API reference for createStore
test: add tests for selector optimization
```

### Submitting Your PR

1. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Create a pull request on GitHub
3. Fill out the PR template completely
4. Link any related issues
5. Request review from maintainers

### PR Requirements

Your PR must:

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- All new features must include tests
- Tests should cover both happy path and edge cases
- Use descriptive test names
- Group related tests in `describe` blocks
- Mock external dependencies

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('Feature Name', () => {
  describe('specific functionality', () => {
    it('should do something specific', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- index.test.ts
```

### Coverage Requirements

- All branches must be tested
- All functions must be tested
- All edge cases should be covered

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Use JSDoc comments for all public APIs
- Include examples in documentation
- Document complex algorithms or logic
- Keep comments up to date with code changes
